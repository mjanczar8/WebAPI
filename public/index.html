    <p>I chose to do game I play as my topic for my ordered list. The games are not in a specific order but are some of my favorites. The two links lead to the Call of Duty website, and the Path of Exile website. I have been playing a lot of Path of Exile 2 lately and have been really enjoying it. Im still not sure if I like it better then PoE1.</p>
